This is an assignment from the Odin Project to practice TDD and Rspec. It's a Connect Four game to be played in the command line: players have to drop pieces into the board and if a player manages to fill up four consecutive cells with same symbol horizontally, vertically or diagonally they win.
 
In order to build the program I followed the instructions of the assignment: figure out what needs to happen, write a (failing) test for it, then write the code to make that test pass, then see if thereâ€™s anything you can do to refactor your code and make it better. The game setup was similar to previous projects, the only thing I struggled with was finding a method to check win combinations. I also found writing the failing tests before the actual code a bit challenging at first, but it was a great exercise to practice Rspec and get familiar with TDD.
